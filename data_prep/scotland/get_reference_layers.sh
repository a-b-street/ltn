🚗 Manually download car ownership CSV (buckle up, it's a wild ride!)
  1. Go to https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/search-the-census#/topics
  2. Search for "UV405". That's the "Car or van availability" table.
  3. For "Choose location type", under "Advanced area types", choose "Data Zone 2011" to match our existing geometries.
  4. Press "Select All". After a bit you should see a table of data.
  4. Top right, choose "Comma Separated Value (.csv)"
     ⚠️ BEWARE: Do not pick "CSV String Value (.csv)" which aggregates the rows very differntly.
  5. Press "Download Table". There should be about ~7k rows.
  5. mv \$downloaded_file ./input/car_ownership_data_zones.csv
  6. Manually delete the front-matter - it looks like this:
       1 SuperWEB2(tm)
       2 
       3 "household2022NotVisibleFromCatalogueScreen"
       4 "Scotland's Census 2022 - National Records of Scotland Table UV405 - Car or van availability All occupied households"
       5 "Intermediate Zone - Data Zone 2011 by Number of cars or vans"
       6 "Counting: Households"
       7 
       8 Filters:
       9 "Default Summation","Households"
      10 
  7. Manually delete the weird "second header" row which only has one column, after the first header row. It looks like this:
       2 "Intermediate Zone - Data Zone 2011",
  8. Manually delete the back-matter at the end of the csv - it looks like this:
    6989
    6990
    6991 "INFO","Data has been perturbed"
    6992
    6993

      > 6977 input/car_ownership_data_zones.csv

      $ head -n 1 input/car_ownership_data_zones.csv
      > "Number of cars or vans","All occupied households","Number of cars or vans in household: No cars or vans","Number of cars or vans in household: One car or van","Number of cars or vans in household: Two cars or vans","Number of cars or vans in household: Three cars or vans","Number of cars or vans in household: Four or more cars or vans",

      $ tail -n1 input/car_ownership_data_zones.csv
